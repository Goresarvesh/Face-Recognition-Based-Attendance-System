# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

The purpose of a face recognition-based attendance system is to automate the 
attendance marking process in various settings, such as schools, colleges, offices, and other 
institutions. The system uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals and record 
their attendance without requiring any manual intervention. 


This type of attendance system offers several benefits, including: 


 Efficiency: The system can quickly identify and record attendance, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual processes. 

 Accuracy: Face recognition technology is highly accurate and can identify individuals with a high degree of accuracy. 

 Security: The system can help prevent instances of proxy attendance and other fraudulent activities. 

 Cost-effective: By automating the attendance marking process, the system can help 
reduce costs associated with manual attendance management.
